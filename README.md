# Travel App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to build out a travel app that, at a minimum, obtains a desired trip location & date from the user, and displays weather and an image of the location using information obtained from external APIs. 

## Instructions
1) "npm install" to install the dependencies
2) "npm run build" to create the dist folder
3) "npm start" to run the app
4) the app listens on port 3000, so http://localhost:3000 is the web address
